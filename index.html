                                <p>
                                    The first time I met Sarah was over email. I was on Thanksgiving break and she was busy starting her new job. Of course it happened to be at the same place that I work and so Sarah was already busy sending emails to people she hadn't met telling them they needed to finish such-and-such at work - I happened to be one of those people. Those of you that know Sarah will likely agree that she is one of the hardest workers you'll ever meet. But of course under all of that toughness she is also the most sincere, caring and beautiful people I've ever met.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So given Sarah's nature and fun-loving spirit it wasn't long before I was spending every hour I could with her. This lead to us both being at the office constantly followed by trips for late night dinners and catching games at Dave and Busters. Now through this whole time I'm thinking she is totally into me. I mean come-on, spending that much time together!? That had to be a sign right? Well she's going to tell you that she had know idea I liked her - even though I still don't believe that :)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Eventually she decided to give me a chance. She says it like this, "Well you grew on me...kinda like a fungus". So romantic! But given the months of effort it was the best thing I'd ever heard. A few years later we found ourselves on top of a small hilltop village in Italy named San Gimignano and a few hours after that she finally completely gave in. I will probably always give her a hard time about how hard it was for her to finally date me (and that she's a Niners fan), but I know the rest of our lives will be filled with laughter and love. I'm so happy I found my soulmate.
                                </p>

                                <strong>From BFF...</strong>
                                <p>I met Bryce at work, at G2. When I joined the company, I was told I’d be working on a big project with the programmer, Bryce, who would eventually be reporting to me. Fortunately for us, the latter did not happen =). I didn’t meet Bryce until a week or so after I started since he was on vacation. But when we met, we totally clicked and hit it off. We got along great and worked well together. Over the next few of months, I got to know Bryce really well as we spent a LOT of time working late nights and weekends. I thought of Bryce as my BFF at the office. He was the person I would go to for advice or if I needed to vent. And whether it was grabbing coffee, food, or watching the games, we had a lot of fun just hanging out together. </p>

                                <strong>To BF...</strong>
                                <p>Bryce and I were good friends for about a year before we started dating. But, if you ask Bryce, he would tell you that we started dating much earlier. To this day, he still tries to convince me (and others) that our 1st date was at Dave &amp; Busters only a few months after we met. We went to happy hour together to watch a UCLA vs Cal basketball game. What he fails to mention is that other people were invited too but bailed last minute so it happened to just be us.</p>
                                 
                                <p>At first, I only thought of Bryce as a friend. But the more we hung out together the more he grew on me (like a fungus). We had great chemistry but I was hesitant to date Bryce because we were friends and colleagues. But I guess it was only a matter of time before I could no longer resist the Montanian charm and Bryce’s awesome dance moves (For those of you who have not seen it, Bryce’s hips don’t lie). So after several months of hanging out, I decided to give Bryce a chance which ended up being one of the best decisions I have ever made. And that’s how the BFF became the BF. &lt;3</p>

                                <strong>To F...</strong>
                                <p>For those of you who know Bryce, you know that he is an amazing and wonderful guy. He’s smart, talented, funny, charming, down to earth, and fun loving. But what you may not know is that Bryce is also a hopeless romantic. He’s full of wonderful surprises and never ceases to amaze me. And the biggest and best surprise of all happened last September when we took a trip to Italy that would forever change our lives. We were in a small town in Tuscany called San Gimignano when Bryce got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. Although it took me a moment to comprehend what was going on and I may have blurted out unknowingly… Are you serious??. There was no doubt in my mind what my answer would be. It would always be YES!</p>

                                <p>When I look back at all the time we spent together, I can’t help but think how lucky I am to be marrying my best friend. Bryce is my perfect mate and my ultimate fungai (fun guy). And I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with him.</p>

Let's see he almost shot my eye out with a bb-gun (he will tell you the story in a heartbeat if you haven't heard it), he was famous for driving my friends crazy (so much so that they rode bikes to our house just to kick his butt) and he will brag endlessly about how much better he is than me at video games (and fishing and shooting and...). Regardless we still find ourselves living in the same city and calling each other up to hang out all the time. I guess sometimes someone can drive you crazy enough that when they aren't around you miss it. I love you buddy.

                                        <strong>Ryan Wells - Hometown Buddy</strong>
                                        Ryan is one of the people in my life that no matter where I am or how long it's been since we've seen each other, I know that the moment we are together we will pick up where we last left off. I've known Ryan since I was in fourth grade. We played football together in High School and I would come home to watch his games at the University of Montana during college. I do credit him with playing at least a part in making me complain about my stomach for the rest of my life (not only does he do the same thing but we spent one school year eating nothing but burritos and chicken strips for lunch). Also there was a time when we could recite every single line of Nelly's album Country Grammar and the movie Dumb and Dumber. Chances are probably still can.

                                        TK and I go waaaay back. Before I moved from MT to CA in 2nd grade, we would be at his house playing with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and finding spiders in his garage. Once I came back from CA we continued our friendship that lasts to this day. From starting our own wolf pack in High School (I'm talking the WCW here - real deal) to destroying anyone who plays us in Beer Pong we are a life-long team. You're the man TK!

                                        Tom and I become great friends through our time at Phi Delta Theta together. He was my roommate senior year and always the first guy to be there for me whenever I needed him. Tom is a person who is 100 percent true to himself and what he believes in. I've always looked up to him for his ability to make people laugh and relax. Oh and also whenever I find myself in a scotch bar in NYC he is the first one I call for advice.

She’s fun loving and easy to get along with. From diapers to dresses, we’ve been inseparable and always getting into trouble together. We know everything about each other (no filters). She’s always been there for me through thick and thin and no matter where we live (LA, Vegas, or the Bay) it never feels like we’re apart. There was no question who I’d ask to be my MOH and I feel honored she said yes. I wouldn’t be able to say I do… Without my Euni there too. I love you LL! (more than you’ll ever know haha).

Cindy is super talented and crafty. I like to think of her as the Korean Martha Stewart. She throws great parties and is the Hostess with the Mostess. We were roomies for 3 years, living in where I refer to as the “ghetto of West LA” and shared some memorable experiences living together. From unwanted pests to watching the games at some sports bar, Cindy has been a big part of my college/LA experience. I’m so happy she will be there next to me as I start this new exciting chapter in my life.

From visiting Hannah at the dorms when I was in High School to asking her for advice during college recruiting, I’ve always looked up to her and admired her. She’s an entrepreneur with great ideas and I enjoy our brainstorming sessions. I look forward to the hopes of starting a family business together some day.

She’s been my hiking buddy and partner when going out. From ripped seams to traveling across the country to “Hangover” nights, we have some unforgettable memories together. There’s no one else I rather get stranded at a rest stop for over 5 hours OR in the pouring rain than my girl, Jina. (Boo to NJ gas stations not selling beer). Although, I can’t hang with all the shopping, I will always have her back (ehem kclub)!  You’ll always be my little Diva and fellow Minime. MGW!!

I remember when they started dating that I just couldn’t wait to meet her (especially after the head of cabbage story). And when I did, I quickly fell in love with her. I mean who wouldn’t?  Mandy is the biggest sweetheart and always a lot of fun to be around. She’s an amazing baker. (4 words…. Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookies mmmm). Mandy has been there from the beginning of our relationship and is the biggest cheerleader of Brarah. She is a friend for life and I am thrilled to have her by my side as Bryce and I say our vows.

                                        Vannie and I went to Middle and High School together and she’s always been like a sister to me. We cried when we went our separate ways to college and I was worried that she would starve to death. Vannie is the only person I know that could burn cup o noodles. After graduating, we found ourselves moving back home at the same time. We spent every weekend together and called ourselves the 3 musketeers (with our friend Will). We were roomies and each other’s wing woman until she met her hubby, Ken. I was there after their 1st date and by her side when they got married. We’ve always been a part of all the milestones in each other’s lives and I couldn’t imagine not having her by my side on my wedding day. I love you my Vannie Poo!
